## Tuples and Lists
Python has two other sequence structures: tuples and lists.

Tuples are `immutable`, when you asssign element (only one) to a tuple, they're baked in the cake and can't be changed

- immutable (can't add/change)
- Useful for fixed data 
- Faster than Lists
- Sequence type

Lists are `mutable`, meaning you can insert and delete elements. 

- General purpose
- Most widely used data structure
- Grow and shrink size as neede
- Sequence type
- Sortable
